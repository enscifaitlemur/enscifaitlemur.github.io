                &#8618;Following the pré-selection by the guardianship agency, 3 candidates among the 11 applicants are presented to the members of the executive board.
                <br><a>&#8597;</a><span><h3>
                - Jeanne Gailhoustet : Head of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Art of Limoges-Aubusson<br>

                - Rémy Fenzy : Former head of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Photographie of Arles<br><br>

                The student representatives of the various school comitees share the three applications and organise video interviews with each candidate, open to all students. Around twenty students participate in these interviews.<br>

                The students endorse M.Mahé and M<sup>rs.</sup> Gailhoustet. The school staff is in agreement with the students. The two candidates seem well informed about ENSCI, and carry a real project and ambition for the school, in which the students can find themselves.<br>

                Following these debates, the discovery of an open letter written by the students of the Ecole de Photographie of Arles strengthens our position. The letter denounces a lack of transparency in the decision making process and a poor management of human relations.</h3></span>

                <br>After presenting the three candidates, discussions and debates, the student representatives read a text to summarise the debates among the student body and their position:<br>
                Two votes for the nomination of M<sup>rs.</sup> Gailhoustet and M. Mahé, the note of intent of M. Fenzy being consideres as « an accumulation of generalist mesures, often already existing at ENSCU - leading to believe that he did not take interest in the singular model of our school. »<br>
                The Ministry of Economics representative suggests that the guardianship agency representatives do not vote of the candidates, as they have already selected the three candidates. The Ministry of Culture representatives oppose this proposal.<br>
                During the debates, that largely endorse M<sup>rs</sup> Gailhoustet and M. Mahé, the Ministry of Culture representatives keep expressing their interest in M. Fenzy's application.<br>
                The results of this advisory vote (13 people) are as follows :<br>
                - 11 votes for M<sup>rs</sup> Gailhoustet<br>
                - 7 votes for M. Mahé<br>
                - 4 voix for M. Fenzy<br>
                The Ministry of Economics representatives abstain from voting.<br>
                The 4 votes for M. Fenzy are from the three Ministry of Culture representatives and from one professional organisation representative.<br>
                This advise is given to the guardianship agencies. They hold the decision-making power, but in reality only the Ministry of Culture will decide, and that of the Ministry of Economics will stand with that decision.</h3></span>

                Contrary to the nomination of the previous school direction, where the executive board advice had been followed, it seems the minitries no longer have the same willingness to listen. M. Mazoyer worries about the real importance given to the executive board especially in this type of critical decision. He asks the ministries for clarifications, and expresses reservations as to the continuation of hsi tenure on the executive board.<br>
				At the same time, candidates are sought for the presicency of the executive board, a position vacant for a while. A school alumni, nominated, turns down the offer after learning her tenure will certainly be combined with that of M. Fenzy.

               The exchange is respectful and direct. The students inquire M. Fenzy about his project and ambition for the school. This decision, while cordial, is not convincing. M.

			   In late afternoon, a general assmbly is organized at ENSCI. The decision is taken to maintain our opposition to the nomination of M. Fenzy, and to contest the opaque hiring process conducted by the ministries and the failure to take into account our opinion. Finally, the general assembly decides to organise a protest the next day in front of the General Office for Artistic Creation (DGCA).

                A 6 students delegation is received in the afternoon by M<sup>rs</sup> Tarsot-Gillery, M. Perrault, M<sup>rs</sup> Chapus et M. Brunaux. We reiterate our arguments and our claims by asking for M. Fenzy's application to be disregarded for the benefit of one of the two other candidates. The DGCA argues in support of M. Fenzy by the willingness to propose a second term mandate at Limoges for M<sup>rs</sup> Gailhoustet and by the fact that M. Mahé never directed a National School before. In their opinion, M. Fenzy was rather successful in his previous position at Arles. We are also being informed that he is currently available, and wishes to head a school. For us, he therefore seems to be the default choice, not one decided according to the ambition carried to ENSCI.<br>
				At the end of this meeting, we get the DGCA to agree to transfer our grievances to the ministers. The DGCA commits to contact them in the afternoon, and to come back to us by the end of the week.
